## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Iraklis,
and I've been hooked on programming since I delved into my inaugural machine learning project back in 2023. Armed with a background in mathematical physics, I found myself captivated by the intricate mathematics underlying neural networks â€” from fundamental linear algebra concepts to the more abstract realms of universal approximation theory.

As the sands of time flowed, my fascination shifted towards the core of programming languages. I gradually gravitated towards a backend-centric role, relishing tasks such as web development, UI creation, and library development. Currently, I'm putting the finishing touches on my wedding RSVP web app, adding a touch of technology to our special day. Now, I'm on the lookout for opportunities to leverage my skills in a dynamic startup environment, working closely with a tight-knit team where I can swiftly make a meaningful impact.

ðŸ’¡ If you're on the lookout for a passionate developer to join your team, I'm eager to chat! Let's explore how I can contribute to your exciting projects. ðŸš€
